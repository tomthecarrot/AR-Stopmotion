/**
 The MRRemoteManager class serves as a singleton who manages discovering and
 connecting to nearby Mira Prism Remotes.
 
 While MRRemote is a representation of the physical remote, almost any actions performed
 involving remotes, such as discovering or connecting to them, is handled by
 MRRemoteManager.
 
 Additionally, MRRemoteManager also serves as a way to retrieve the device's current Bluetooth
 state, which can help dictate what needs to be shown in your UI at any point.
