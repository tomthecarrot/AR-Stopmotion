/**
 The MRRemoteButtonInput class represents a physical button on the Mira Prism Remote.
 
 A MRRemoteButtonInput can be in one of two states: pressed, or not pressed.
 
 You may choose to either poll the state of the button every event loop, or be notified when the pressed state changes.
 When the pressed state changes, -[MRRemoteButtonInput isPressed] will reflect the new state,
 and the pressedChangedHandler will be called, if one has been assigned.
