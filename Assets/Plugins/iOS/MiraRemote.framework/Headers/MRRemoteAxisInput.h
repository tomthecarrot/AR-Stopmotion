/**
 The MRRemoteAxisInput class represents an analog input measuring a user's touch along a linear axis.
 
 A MRRemoteAxisInput's value ranges from -1 to 1, depending on the position of the touch along the axis.
 
 You may choose to either poll the state of the input every event loop, or be notified when the value changes.
 When the value changes, -[MRRemoteAxisInput value] will reflect the new state,
 and the valueChangedHandler will be called, if one has been assigned.
