/**
 The MRRemoteTouchInput class represents an input triggered by a user's touch on the Mira Prism Remote.
 
 A MRRemoteTouchInput can be in one of two states: active, or inactive.
 
 You may choose to either poll the state of the input every event loop, or be notified when the active state changes.
 When the active state changes, -[MRRemoteTouchInput isActive] will reflect the new state,
 and the activeChangedHandler will be called, if one has been assigned.
