 * @brief WTImageRecognitionRangeExtension defines if ImageTracker should use an optimized algorithm to detect target images in greater distance to the camera.
 *
 * Extending the recognition range requires HD camera frames processing and therefore needs more CPU power than the default recognition range.
 *
 * @discussion Extending the recognition distance requires more computational power of the CPU. Because of this we recommend to let the Wikitude SDK itself decide if this feature should be used on the current device or not.
