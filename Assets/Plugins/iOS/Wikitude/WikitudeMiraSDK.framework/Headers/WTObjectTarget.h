/**
 * WTObjectTarget represents object targets that are found by an object tracker.
 *
 * x/y/z scale values can be used to convert the 'unit cube' modelView matrix into a box that covers just the outer dimensions of the object.
 * Example: Consider a truck like shaped object target. In case an OpenGL/Metal cube with edge length of one would be drawn with the modelView matrix, the cube would be drawn without distortions in the center of the object.
 * To render a box around the truck, x/y/z scale values are used to create another scale matrix that is multiplied with the given modelView matrix. The result is then a box that encompasses the object target at it's outer dimensions.
